# Dato::Rails

Use [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/) in your Rails application.

This gem allows you to fetch data using Dato GraphQL APIs and render the content in your Rails app.

ðŸ‘‰ See [this simple tutorial to get started on dev.to](https://dev.to/coorasse/datocms-with-ruby-on-rails-3ae5). ðŸ‘ˆ

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dato-rails', require: 'dato'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dato-rails

The gem is made of two parts:

## GraphQL client

The GraphQL client based on [GQLi](https://github.com/contentful-labs/gqli.rb) allows to perform
queries to the GraphQL endpoint.
Look at GQLi documentation for more information about the syntax of queries.
You can also find some examples in specs of this library.

Set your api token as `DATO_API_TOKEN` environment variable or as
`Rails.application.credentials.dig(:dato, :api_token)`.
ENV variable will have precedence.

```ruby
client = Dato::Client.new # you can also pass the api token here.
query = GQLi::DSL.query {
  homepage {
    id
  }
}
response = client.execute(query)

puts response.data.homepage.id
```

We provide a fragment to extract a Responsive Image.

```ruby
GQLi::DSL.query {
  homepage {
    id
    content {
      value
      blocks {
        __typename
        id
        image {
          responsiveImage(imgixParams: { fm: __enum("png") }) {
            ___ Dato::Fragments::ResponsiveImage
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## View rendering

The library is also a Rails Engine and provides a whole set of ViewComponents to render your content.
The library aims to provide the most basic components and make it easy to create new one.

Once you fetched the response of a query, you can use the Dato ViewComponents to render the content.

If you have a StructuredText component, you can render it with:

```ruby
render Dato::StructuredText.new(response.data.homepage.content)
```

If you have a responsive image, you can render it with:

```ruby
render Dato::ResponsiveImage.new(node.image.responsiveImage)
```

Read more about [StructuredText - Custom Nodes](docs/custom_nodes.md).

## Preview and live

The `Dato::Client` supports
both [preview](https://www.datocms.com/docs/pro-tips/how-to-manage-a-live-and-a-preview-site)
and [live updates](https://www.datocms.com/docs/real-time-updates-api) features from Dato CMS.

```ruby
Dato::Client.new(preview: true) # to fetch draft versions

client = Dato::Client.new(live: true) # => to fetch a live straming URL 
client.live!(your_query)
# => { url: 'https://your_event_source_url' }
```

A `ViewComponent` is provided to use both these features very easily!

Given that you have a `MyComponent` that takes in input only the result of a dato query,
you probably have the following:

```ruby
result = Dato::Client.new.execute!(my_query)
render(MyComponent.new(result.data))
```

you can now wrap everything in a `Dato::Wrapper` component like this:

```ruby
render(Dato::Wrapper.new(MyComponent, my_query, preview: true, live: true))
```

and your component will come to life with live updates ðŸŽ‰ (requires turbo).

## CRUD Operations

The library also provides a set of helpers to perform CRUD operations on Dato CMS.

### All

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.items.all(item_type_id: '456')
```

### Find

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.items.find(item_id: '123')
```

### Create

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.items.create(attributes: { title: 'Hello world' }, item_type_id: '456')
```

### Update

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.items.update(attributes: { title: 'Hello world' }, item_id: '123')
```

### Destroy

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.items.destroy(item_id: '123')
```

## File upload

Dato Rails also supports file uploads.
These can be created either from a local file or from a url.
Basically all file types are supported, as long as they are valid in the CMS.
Be aware that dato jobs are not synchronous, so you may need to
implement some kind of polling to check if the upload is finished.
The create method returns a job id, which can be used to retrieve the upload result.

> In addition to the binary file, also attributes and metadata can be uploaded.
> Both metadata and attributes are optional.
> Provide attributes according to the [docs](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api/resources/upload)

### Upload from Url

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.uploads.create_from_url('https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300')
Dato::Client.new.uploads.create_from_url('https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300', attributes:)
```

### Upload from Local File

```ruby
file = File.open('image.png')

Dato::Client.new.uploads.create_from_file(file.path)
Dato::Client.new.uploads.create_from_file(file.path, attributes:)
```

### Optional: Attributes and metadata

```ruby
meta = { en: { title: 'Static Random Image', alt: 'some caption text' } }
attributes = { author: 'Dato Rails', default_field_metadata: meta }
```

### Optional: Filename

```ruby
Dato::Client.new.uploads.create_from_url('https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300', filename: 'test.png')
Dato::Client.new.uploads.create_from_file(file.path, filename: 'test.png')
```

### Getting the upload id

As the file upload is asynchronous, you may need to implement some kind of polling to check if the upload is finished.
With the retrieve_job_result method you can retrieve the upload id from the job result.

```ruby
job_id = client.uploads.create_from_file(file.path) # get back a job id
response = client.uploads.retrieve_job_result(job_id).parse # check the status
upload_id = response.dig('data', 'attributes', 'payload', 'data', 'id') # if nil, it's not done yet
```

## Configuration

The following options are available:

```ruby
# config/initializers/dato.rb

Dato::Config.configure do |config|
  config.overrides = {} # default: {}
  config.blocks = {} # default: {}
  config.cache = false # default: false
  config.cache_namespace = 'dato-rails' # default: 'dato-rails'
  config.api_token = ENV['DATO_PUBLISH_KEY'] # default: ENV.fetch("DATO_API_TOKEN", Rails.application.credentials.dig(:dato, :api_token))
  config.publish_key = ENV['DATO_PUBLISH_KEY'] # default: ENV.fetch("DATO_PUBLISH_KEY", Rails.application.credentials.dig(:dato, :publish_key))
  config.build_trigger_id = ENV['DATO_BUILD_TRIGGER_ID'] # default: ENV.fetch("DATO_BUILD_TRIGGER_ID", Rails.application.credentials.dig(:dato, :build_trigger_id))
  config.base_editing_url = ENV['DATO_BASE_EDITING_URL'] # default: ENV.fetch("DATO_BASE_EDITING_URL", Rails.application.credentials.dig(:dato, :base_editing_url))
  config.mount_path = '/dato' # default: '/dato'
end
```

## Caching

The library supports caching of the rendered components.
If you enable caching, the components rendered using `Dato::Wrapper`, will be cached.

To enable caching, you need to set the `cache` option in the configuration.

```ruby
# config/initializers/dato.rb

Dato::Config.configure do |config|
  config.cache = 1.day # if you set it to `true`, it will default to 60 minutes
end
```

Now a call to

```ruby
render(Dato::Wrapper.new(MyComponent, my_query))
```

will be cached for 1 day.

This means that for the next 24 hours, the graphQL endpoint will not be invoked and the whole component rendering will
also be skipped.

**We will cache the entire HTML result of the component, not only the graphQL response.**

If you want to expire the cache you have two options:

### manual

executing `Dato::Cache.clear!` or running `bin/rails dato:cache:clear`.

### publish endpoint

You can take advantage of the publish mechanism of Dato CMS to expire the cache.

* Generate a new secret key with `bin/rails secret` and set it as `DATO_PUBLISH_KEY` environment variable or in Rails Credentials as `dato.publish_key`.
* Create a build trigger with a custom webhook on your Dato CMS project setting.
* Define the Trigger URL as `https://yourapp.com/dato/publish`
* Set the `DATO_PUBLISH_KEY` as the Authorization header
* Copy the build trigger id and set it as `DATO_BUILD_TRIGGER_ID` environment variable.

![docs/build_trigger_configuration.png](docs/build_trigger_configuration.png)

### Caching of graphQL response / Controller helpers

If you are not using ViewComponents or you need to cache a single GraphQL query, you can still do it using the
`Dato::Cache` helper.

In your controllers you already have a helper method `execute_dato_query`.
You can use it in your controller action and queries results will be automatically cached if:

* You have `Dato` cache enabled
* You have Rails cache enabled (check your environment configuration)
* you are not displaying a preview

```ruby
response = execute_dato_query(blog_post_query(params[:slug]), preview: params[:preview])
@data = response.data
```

by using this helper, subsequent calls towards Dato will be cached.

## Logs instrumentation

In the logs you will see the time taken to fetch the data from Dato CMS.
For example:

```
Completed 200 OK in 365ms (Views: 109.5ms | ActiveRecord: 0.7ms (4 queries, 0 cached) | Dato: 254.3ms | GC: 0.0ms)`
```

this is useful to identify if the bottleneck is in the fetching of the data from Dato CMS.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

You can now clone the dato-rails project

[![Clone DatoCMS project](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone?projectId=57262&name=dato-rails
)

You then need to set a `DATO_API_TOKEN=abcd123x` in the `.env` file on the root of your project
to consume data from your project. For testing purposes, set `TEST_MODEL_TYPE_ID=1234` in the `.env` file
with the id of the author model type in your project.

Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests.

You can also run `rails console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`,
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag,
and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
